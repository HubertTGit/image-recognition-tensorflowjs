# Image Recognition Demo with TensorFlow.js

![Image Detection with TensorFlowJs]([https://github.com/HubertTGit/image-recognition-tensorflowjs/assets/98665493/ab6b07cd-c35b-467e-8cc9-87da02e3c945])

## Overview

This project demonstrates image recognition capabilities using TensorFlow.js, built within a ReactJS framework. It showcases how to integrate machine learning models directly into a web application for real-time image processing and classification.

## Features

- **Real-Time Image Recognition:** Utilize TensorFlow.js to perform image recognition in the browser.
- **React Integration:** Seamlessly incorporate TensorFlow.js within a ReactJS application.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for uploading and classifying images.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js:** JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser.
- **ReactJS:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
